The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem or the hailstone sequence, is an unsolved mathematical problem that has intrigued mathematicians for decades. The conjecture is named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. Despite its simplicity, the problem remains unsolved, making it one of the most notorious unsolved problems in mathematics.

## The Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture focuses on a sequence of numbers, starting with any positive integer. If the number is even, it is divided by 2, and if it is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and then incremented by 1. This process is repeated on the resulting number, creating a sequence of numbers. The conjecture states that, regardless of the starting number, this sequence will always eventually reach the number 1.

## Developments and Investigations

Since its introduction, the Collatz Conjecture has captured the attention of mathematicians worldwide, leading to numerous investigations and developments in an attempt to prove or disprove the conjecture. While many properties of the sequence have been uncovered, a general proof or counterexample has yet to be found.

Various computational methods have been employed to explore the behavior of the Collatz sequence for different ranges of initial values. These investigations have led to intriguing patterns and observations, revealing the complexity of the problem. Excel files have been compiled, documenting the number of steps required to reach 1 for different initial values, providing valuable insights into the conjecture.
